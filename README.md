ðŸ”¹ Title & Description

    Receiptly â€” Smart Receipt OCR + Expense Tracker:
    
        - Upload any receipt through a modern web UI and instantly get a structured JSON summary with merchant, items, 
          total, currency, and date â€” powered by AWS Textractâ€™s analyze_expense API, serverless Lambda functions, and DynamoDB storage.
        - Futureâ€‘ready with CI/CD, history tracking, and planned analytics dashboard.

ðŸ”¹ Demo

    - Live frontend: [S3 Hosted Frontend Link]

ðŸ”¹ Architecture Overview

    - Upload receipt via web frontend
    - Frontend requests a preâ€‘signed S3 URL from API Gateway
    - Receipt image uploaded directly to S3 (uploads/)
    - S3 event triggers ocrProcessor Lambda
    - AWS Textract (analyze_expense) extracts structured receipt data
    - Custom parser cleans and formats data into structured JSON
    - Parsed JSON saved to parsed/ folder in the same S3 bucket
    - Summary record (merchant, date, total, currency) stored in DynamoDB
    - getReceipts Lambda fetches receipts by merchant/date using GSIs
    - Planned: Dashboard for analytics, filtering, and CSV export

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

    - AWS S3 â€” Receipt storage (uploads & parsed data)
    - AWS Lambda â€” Serverless OCR processing (ocrProcessor) + query API (getReceipts)
    - AWS Textract â€” analyze_expense for structured OCR data
    - AWS DynamoDB â€” Persistent structured receipt data + GSIs (Merchant & Date)
    - AWS API Gateway â€” REST API for upload & receipt queries
    - GitHub Actions â€” CI/CD for automated Lambda deployments
    - IAM & CloudWatch â€” Permissions and logging
    - HTML/CSS/JavaScript â€” Responsive upload UI
